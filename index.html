	<p>	I'm a Software Engineer, Architect and Manager. I've been developing for 20 something years in various programming languages.  My primary language interests are:
	<ul>
		<li>C#</li>
		<li>Java</li>
		<li>Scala</li>
		<li>Python</li>
		<li>Golang</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	I have also used various other things a lot, like SQLServer and Oracle - MVC and Microservices - build automation and a lot of other things.
	</p>

	<p>
	Computer-wise I enjoy Computer Science problems, Machine Learning, and music related things like creating and occasionally micro-controller related programming for music.
