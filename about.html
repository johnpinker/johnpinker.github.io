	<h1>About John</h1>
	<p>A lot of my computer science related things are listed on the frotn page, but other than that these are a few of the things I enjoy and have done outside of that.</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Movies - especially <a href="https://www.criterion.com" target="_blank">Criterion Movies</a> and our local theater <a href="http://www.belcourt.org" target="_blank">The Belcourt</a></li>
			<li>Music - I like playing, listening and building things.  Guitars, amps, effects, synthesizers, etc.  I enjoy several genres but mt main ones are probably Jazz, Rockabilly, and electronic.</li>
			<li>Travel - I enjoy traveling with my family and visiting exotic and southern places.</li>
		</ul>
